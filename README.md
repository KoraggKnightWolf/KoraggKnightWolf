### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing my Bachelor's degree.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about linux server maintenance in general.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything IRC-related.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving Linux/Unix skills in general, and about any programming language I might need along the way.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why I prefer IRC over other messaging/communication platforms.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Koragg (or at times KoraggKnightWolf) on "most" "known" and/or "popular" IRC networks.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Luke Smith called me a boomer for using IRC, despite being 30.
