### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Arch Linux and how to apply custom Manjaro aspects (Manjaro's zsh, bootup theme, grub menu etc) to Arch
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Arch based systems better and use the ABS (Arch Build System) for custom PKGBUILD files, for 
         personal use and/or to upload to the AUR.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any PKGBUILD in the AUR that is maintained by me (currently just archlinux-hello as of Nov 23rd, 2022)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving Linux/Unix skills in general, and about any programming language I might need along the way.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why I prefer IRC over other messaging/communication platforms.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Koragg on "most" "known" and/or "popular" IRC networks.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Luke Smith called me a boomer for using IRC, despite being in my 20's.
